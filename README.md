# Metal Band Guessr — minimal runner

This repo contains a small dataset and a minimal Streamlit app to preview it.

Quick steps to run locally (Windows PowerShell):

1. Create or activate your virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

```powershell
streamlit run app.py
```

Alternatively run the quick test to verify `data_loader`:

```powershell
python test_load.py
```
